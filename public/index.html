            <h1>Welcome To My Digital Space</h1>
            <p>
                Hi! My name is Mason Conelius and I am an aspiring Software Engineer/Data Analyst. I'm currently studying a Bachelor of Software Engineering <br> 
                at Torrens University Australia. I made this static website with the goal of having an online portfolio demonstrating my knowledge. However <br>
                while planning and learning the ropes of web development, I realised I could also incorporate many of my passions, turning this site into both <br>
                a portfolio and a passion project which now acts as an outlet for me to express my opinions toward my favourite things. <br>
                My various passions that I decided to include into this project are: gaming, music, tv shows, esports, soccer/football, and travelling. <br>
                I really enjoy the organisational aspect of creating this website, including the correct hierarchical order of headings and subheadings, <br>
                determining appropriate colour patterns and design layouts, and expressing my opinions on the categories covered through writing them down <br>
                and creating tables. For me, I view this site as both a professional portfolio, and as a healthy outlet to vent my frustrations and/or enjoyment <br>
                on a variety of topics that I follow closely. Even if nobody end up viewing this peronsal wiki, I still find it comforting believing there are <br>
                people out there that are lsitening to what I have to say about what I find interesting and entertaining.

            <p>
                I acknowledge this site has room for improvement, but as a first project I am proud of it. <br>
                The future improvements I would like to implement are as follows:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Create a css file and include a sidebar, hero image, and basic background</li>
                <li>Create the hero banner for my main page</li>
                <li>Start and finish the education page</li>
            </ul>
